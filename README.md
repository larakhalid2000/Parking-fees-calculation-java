# Parking Fees Calculation System (Java)

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based application that calculates parking fees based on multiple conditions such as permit class, day type, parking lot, and time.
The system reads data from an input file, processes it using custom data structures, and writes the results to an output file.

## Key Features
- File input and output using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
- Custom linked list implementation
- Parking fee calculation logic
- Execution time measurement using Java Clock
- Linear time complexity O(n)

## Technologies Used
- Java
- File I/O
- Data Structures
- Time Complexity Analysis
